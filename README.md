# An-Excel-Project_Coffee-Sales-Dashboard
This is an Excel project where I have built a Coffee Sales Dashboard using coffee orders (raw data) for a particular caf√© that has business in multiple countries.
This project includes:
1. Data cleaning
2. Use of Xlookups, Vlookups, Index Match, and Nested formulas to make new columns and categories
3. Creating Pivot tables, Interactive Timeline and Slicers
4. Intensive data formatting and designing
5. Extraction of information by creating Charts and Presenting them by creating a Dashboard
